                    I'm Zuzana. I enjoy warm weather and that probably sums up 
                    the reason why I moved from San Francisco early 2018 to be 
                    in San Diego. Best decision of my life. 

                    â€‹In San Francisco I got my BFA in Film/Directing and pursued 
                    a Creative Director career. I've directed numerous videos 
                    for clients getting their product started on Kickstarter or 
                    Indiegogo. 
                    
                    Having moved to San Diego I used my directorial skills to 
                    become a Project Manager in Digital Marketing - which has 
                    opened up several more doors into me contributing to Social 
                    Media, Website Editing, Product Photography and more.
                    
                    I am a well rounded, creative, organized individual 
                    with a great work ethic willing to take on new challenges 
                    and excel at former ones.
